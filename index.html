          <h2>Hello!</h2>

              <h3>System Administration</h3>
              <p>As a System Administrator I manage Microsoft Office 365, synced with On-Prem Active Directory. I have created and documented processes for onboard/offboarding of new servers and workstations, employee data retention/destruction, software deployment, and backup checks/validations. Through PowerShell, I have automated password expiration notifications for end-users, routine weak password checks, and routine checks for inactive accounts in Active Directory. With vSphere and vCenter, I have configured, developed, and administered virtual server environments. I have managed server and data migrations with care to preserve integrity and security permissions. I have also implemented and tested security measures across client sites. I also designed, host via AWS EC2, bought the domain, and manage this webpage.</p>

              <h3>Programming and Scripting</h3>
              <p>Through python, I have coded different projects from making my own calculator, a twitter bot that likes and/or retweets messages based off key-words, a desktop weather app that calls from OpenWeatherMap's API, and a file organizer based off extention. I have made Minecraft mods, which is a Java-based game. I have also worked on different scripts in Bash and PowerShell to automate different tasks. I have also taken these skills and applied to them to penetration testing.</p>

              <h3>Sales and Management</h3>
              <p>I have trained peers and subordinates to varying levels of expertise in a given sales environment. I have completed reports detailing strengths, critical areas for growth, and recommendations for next steps to take. I have been a subject matter expert for products and services I am accountable for. I have overlooked the business operations including cash handling, </p>
